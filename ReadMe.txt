Cloud Detection Classification Methods
Stat 154 UC Berkeley, Spring 2019

Description: 
	We were given a large dataset of pixels to classify as either cloudy or not cloudy. The detection algorithm built into the data collection was not extremely accurate, so our job was to find a classification method to maximize the accuracy. This project explores the data visually and quantitatively, prepares it for analysis, and then models it using different methods. The methods include LDA, QDA, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, and KNN. We also analyze the usefulness and accuracy fo the methods. \
